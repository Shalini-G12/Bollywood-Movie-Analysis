# Bollywood Movie Analysis

This repository contains code for analyzing a dataset of Bollywood movies. The analysis explores various aspects of the dataset, including:

* Number of movies released each year
* Movies released by each director
* Distribution of movies by genre
* Top actors appearing in the most movies

The code is written in Python and utilizes libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

## Files Included

* 'Bollywood Movie Analysis.ipynb': This script contains the core code for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
* 'README.md': This file (the one you are reading now) provides an overview of the project.

## How to Run the Analysis

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`). You can install them using `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn`.
3. Open `bollywood_movie_analysis.py` in a Python IDE or code editor.
4. Replace the file path in the `file_path` variable with the path to your local copy of the Bollywood movie dataset CSV file.
5. Run the script.

The script will perform the analysis, generate visualizations, and print the results to the console.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this analysis is assumed to be the "Bollywood Movie Dataset (2023-1951)" available online (provided here).
